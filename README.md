# Cloudflare-to-sheets
Get details from cloudflare API directly into google sheets, using app script.
Functions that i have create on this project are for getin the users that you have gave access to your account, 
Get details like their id, email, 2fa activated or not, and if they have accepted your invitation.

My client was managing multiple cloudflare accounts so these functions also work if you have multiple cloudflare accounts, 
you can simply add the credentials in the credentials file, and remember to also create the sheet with the same name that you have added in the credentials file.
